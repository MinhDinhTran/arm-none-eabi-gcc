# How to publish the GNU MCU Eclipse ARM Embedded GCC binaries?

## Update the Change log

Generally, apart from packing, there should be no local changes compared 
to the original ARM distribution.

Open the `CHANGELOG.txt` file from  
`gnu-mcu-eclipse/arm-none-eabi-gcc-build.git` project git, and copy 
entries to the web git.

In the web git, add new entries to the 
[Change log](https://gnu-mcu-eclipse.github.io/toolchain/arm/change-log/) 
(`pages/toolchain/arm/change-log.md`), grouped by days.

Note: if you missed to update the `CHANGELOG.txt` before starting the build, 
edit the file and rerun the build, it should take only a few minutes to 
recreate the archives with the correct file.

## Edit the build script

Edit the `VERSION` file to refer to the actual release.

## Push the build script git

Push `gnu-mcu-eclipse/arm-none-eabi-gcc-build.git` to GitHub.

Possibly push the helper project too.

## Build

Follow the instructions on the 
[build](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/arm-none-eabi-gcc-build/blob/master/README.md) 
page.

## Create a new GitHub pre-release

- go to the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/arm-none-eabi-gcc/releases) page
- click **Draft a new release**
- name the tag like **v7.2.1-1.1** (mind the dash in the middle!)
- name the release like **GNU MCU Eclipse ARM Embedded GCC v7.2.1-1.1 20180401** 
(mind the dash and the space)
- as description
  - add a downloads badge like `[![Github Releases (by Release)](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/gnu-mcu-eclipse/arm-none-eabi-gcc/v7.2.1-1.1/total.svg)]()`; use empty URL for now
  - draft a short paragraph exlaining what are the main changes
- **attach binaries** and SHA (drag and drop from the archives folder will do it)
- enable the pre-release button
- click the **Publish Release** button

Note: at this moment the system should send a notification to all clients watching this project.

## Prepare a new blog post 

In the web git:

- add a new file to `_posts/arm-none-eabi-gcc/releases`
- name the file like `2018-04-01-arm-none-eabi-gcc-v7-2-1-1-1-released.md`
- name the post like: **GNU MCU Eclipse ARM Embedded GCC v7.2.1-1.1 20180401 released**.
- as `download_url` use the tagged URL like `https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/arm-none-eabi-gcc/releases/tag/v7.2.1-1.1/` 
- update the `date:` field with the current date

If any, close [issues](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/arm-none-eabi-gcc/issues) 
on the way. Refer to them as:

- **[Issue:\[#1\]\(...\)]**.

## Update the SHA sums

Copy/paste the build report at the end of the post as:

```console

```

## Update the Web

- commit the `gnu-mcu-eclipse.github.io-source` project; use a message 
like **GNU MCU Eclipse ARM Embedded GCC v7.2.1-1.1 released**
- wait for the Travis build to complete; occasionally links to not work,
 and might need to restart the build.
- remember the post URL, since it must be updated in the release page

## Create the xPack release

Follow the instructions on the 
[gnu-mcu-eclipse/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/blob/xpack/README.md#maintainer-info)
page.

## Create a final GitHub release

- go to the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/arm-none-eabi-gcc/releases) page
- update the link behind the badge with the blog URL
- add a link to the Web page `[Continue reading Â»]()`; use an same blog URL
- copy/paste the **Easy install** section
- update the current release version
- copy/paste the **Download analytics** section
- update the current release version
- disable the pre-release button
- click the **Update Release** button

## Tag the build commit

In the [gnu-mcu-eclipse/arm-none-eabi-gcc-build](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/arm-none-eabi-gcc-build)
project, add a tag with the current version, like `v8.2.1-1.1` (with *v*).

## Update the README.md

List the new release in the project README.md.
